# MangoHacks CrowdControl


Based on information gathered before events, our system will use an algorithm to determine how to prioritize and incentive customers based on their preferences in order to maximize satisfaction based on consumer expectations.

We have different attributes assigned to customers and events, things like "average ratings," "satisfaction," "category IDs," in order to organize the data and analyze it properly. The goal in the end is to have the consumer attend enough events that the average rating of the events they attend is higher than the initial average rating provided by them.

For instance, let's say that on a cruise ship, there are 5 events that a passenger can go to. When purchasing a ticket, the customer is asked to rate certain categories for events on a scale from 1 to 10. Customer 1, Chris, could rate the Entertainment category a 10, and every other category a 2 -- this makes his average rating lower. Customer 2, Gaby, however, rates every category between a 7 and an 8. Her average is much higher, which means she is more flexible in what events she would to attend. With this information, we can determine that Chris should be a higher priority consumer in terms of trying to increase his satisfaction. Using this data, we can provide incentives for Gaby to go to a different event that they are still interested in, in order to distribute the crowds evenly throughout all the events going on at the same time. This ensures that Chris will be able to go to the event listed in the category he is interested in and make it more enjoyable in the end.
